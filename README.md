Onion Skinnig
=============

This is a very hacky App which allows you to open Images in a semi transparent window.

I've created it so I can place images above the iPhone Simulator to see if my layout is looking pixel perfect the same as the Photoshop designs.

Features
--------

Move the window around with the cursor keys.
Set the opacity of the window with your number keys.

Todos
-----

Mostly everything: remember window opacity, some kind of loupe, an icon, stuff and other things.
